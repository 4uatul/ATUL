# Introduction
Hello, my name is Atul and I am a student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Maharishi Dayanand University. With a cumulative grade point average of 8.75/10, I have developed a strong foundation in various computer science disciplines.

# Work Experience
I have had the opportunity to work as a teaching intern at Gavaksh, where I taught Python programming language to underprivileged children. This experience allowed me to interact with students and enhance my communication and programming skills.

# Relevant Skills and Abilities
I have a strong passion for data science and have honed my skills in this field through various activities and projects. As the captain of the Data Science Club, I have demonstrated leadership skills in leading and motivating over 100 members. I have also completed a course in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning, where I acquired essential skills such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Linear Regression, TensorFlow, and Big Data. Additionally, I am proficient in SQL and have passed the MySQL LinkedIn Skill Assessment Test.

# Projects
One of my most notable projects was the Delhi Property Price Prediction, where I used a linear regression model to predict property prices in Delhi with 76% accuracy. I also worked on a project for Company Sales Insights, where I used Power BI to create a dashboard that provided a clear picture of sales insights, improving accuracy from 50% to 90%.

__I am excited to continue exploring the field of data science and eager to apply my skills and abilities to new challenges and opportunities.__
