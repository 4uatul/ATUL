# About Me
- Hello everyone, I am ATUL from Delhi, India. I am a computer science engineering student and I am currently in my 6th semester of my Bachelor's degree at Maharishi Dayanand University. I have a cumulative grade point average of 8.75/10 and I have taken relevant courses in Data Science, Software Engineering, Python Programming and Data Structure.

- I have a passion for coding and teaching, which led me to do a teaching internship at Gavaksh, where I taught Python programming language to underprivileged children for 100+ hours. I also demonstrated my leadership skills as the captain of the Data Science Club, where I organized and participated in successful webinars and events with 100+ attendees.

- I am skilled in Python, including its libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and TensorFlow. I have also taken advanced courses in Data Science and Machine Learning, where I created 5+ capstone projects using linear regression, logistic regression, and other techniques.

- I have also completed several projects such as Delhi Property Price Prediction, Company Sales Insights, and Railway Ticket Booking and Catering, where I used my programming and analytical skills to solve real-world problems.

- I am also certified in volunteering at an NGO and hold a gold medal in the 100m dashes in college. I have passed the MySQL LinkedIn Skill Assessment Test and I am proud to be ranked 157th among 13,500+ participants in a coding contest.

**I am a fast learner and I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge. If you are looking for a hard-working, dedicated, and skilled individual, I am the one.**
